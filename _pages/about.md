Career Objectives
======
I anticipate completing my Ph.D. program in mid-to-late 2023. Upon graduating, I hope to serve as a postdoc or split-appointment faculty where I can pursue a versatile research program, develop courses, and work with colleagues to implement evidence-based curriculum redesign. If you know of an open position, please feel free to reach out to me (merickson3@wisc.edu)!

Current Research
======
I am interested in sustainable livestock production systems and integrating social and natural sciences methods. Currently, my dairy research focuses on protein and nitrogen efficiency in lactating cows. My discipline-based educational research focuses student-driven, evidence-based modernization of curricula and pedagogies in Animal and Dairy Sciences. To learn more about my research interests, I invite you to peruse [my publications](https://merickson3.github.io/publications/).
