I would love to hear from you. Please see the sidebar for a few ways to keep in touch. 

Career Objectives
-----
I anticipate completing my Ph.D. program in 2023. Upon graduating, I hope to serve as a postdoc or split-appointment faculty where I can pursue a versatile research program, develop courses, and work with colleagues to implement evidence-based curriculum redesign. If you know of an open position, please feel free to reach out to me (merickson3@wisc.edu).

Research Interests
-----
I am interested in sustainable livestock production systems. I use both social and natural sciences methods, although I have a particular interest in quantitative-driven, mixed-methods survey research. Currently, my dairy research focuses on protein and nitrogen efficiency in lactating cows. My discipline-based educational research focuses student-driven, evidence-based modernization of curricula and pedagogies in Animal and Dairy Sciences. To learn more about my research interests, I invite you to peruse [my publications](https://merickson3.github.io/publications/).
